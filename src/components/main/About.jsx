            Hey, I'm Simonas - a dedicated <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> who loves building clean, responsive, and interactive web applications. 
            While I'm still early in my professional journey, I've built a strong foundation in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js</strong>, 
            and recently started expanding into <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> to deepen my backend skills.
            I enjoy solving real problems, polishing user interfaces, and making things work better under the hood.

            I'm also diving into <strong>game development</strong> - a natural fit for someone who enjoys both logic and creativity. 
            Using <strong>Unity</strong>, I've been exploring procedural systems, game feel, and player-focused design.
            One project I'm especially proud of is <strong><a href="https://brucewnd.itch.io/spaceblocks">SpaceBlocks</a></strong>, 
            a puzzle game that mixes <strong>Tetris-inspired mechanics</strong> with fresh twists and strategic depth. 
            For me, game dev is where code becomes play and I'm excited to keep pushing that boundary.
