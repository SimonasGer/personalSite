            Hello! I'm Simonas, a passionate <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> with an insatiable curiosity for building seamless, interactive web experiences. 
            Though I may not have formal industry experience yet, my drive for mastering both front-end and back-end technologies is unwavering. 
            I've developed a solid foundation in **<strong>CSS, HTML, JavaScript, React, and Node.js</strong>, and recently expanded my backend knowledge with <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong>. 
            Currently, I'm diving into <strong>PHP</strong> and preparing to explore <strong>Laravel</strong> to strengthen my development toolkit. 
            I love solving intricate problems, optimizing user experiences, and crafting visually stunning, high-performance applications.

            Beyond web development, I'm also an <strong>aspiring game developer</strong>, fascinated by dynamic mechanics, procedural systems, and immersive storytelling. 
            I've been experimenting in the <strong>Unity</strong> game engine, integrating AI-driven gameplay, and developing mechanics that push creative boundaries. 
            One of my recent projects, <strong><a href="https://brucewnd.itch.io/spaceblocks">SpaceBlocks</a></strong>, merges <strong>Tetris-inspired puzzle mechanics </strong>
            with a modern, dynamic twist, showcasing my ability to craft engaging and strategic gameplay. 
            Game development is where <strong>logic and artistry collide</strong>, and I'm eager to keep exploring this realm of creativity.
